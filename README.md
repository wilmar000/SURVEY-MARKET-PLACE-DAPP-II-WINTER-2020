## Generating ssh key for dapp deployment

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremailhere@example.com" -N ""
```

## SSH private key format
If the private key is not in the PEM format, you will see an `Error loading key "(stdin)": invalid format message`.

Use `ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem` to convert your key file to PEM, but be sure to make a backup of the file first. 

- Public key (extension with `.pub`) ()
- Private key   (deployment secret)
